## OSU CS340 - Blending Oil Movement Bonanza - Final Project (MySQL)

This project is a simple representation of the Oil Movements process at an oil refinery.  The refinery contains many tanks.  Each source tank has materials which can be blended together into a destination tank through tasks and lineups.  The user can perform various CRUD operations to achieve zero safety incidents, make on-spec fuels, and optimize the process.

The website was hosted on Netlify and uses Heroku for the backend routes and database.  The database is MySQL.
